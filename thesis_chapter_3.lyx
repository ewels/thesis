 it allows the physical association of sequences of DNA to be interrogated.
 3C has become a key methodology in the field of nuclear organisation, and
 a number of new techniques use it as a base.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3C works by fixing protein and DNA in place with formaldehyde.
 A restriction enzyme is used to cut the DNA, typically recognising a 6
 base pair sequence, so cutting on average once every 1.2 Kb (
\begin_inset Formula $6^{4}=1296$
\end_inset

).
 This results in

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of cross linked DNA and protein which are diluted into a large volume.
 A ligation reaction is then run, which favours ligations between sequences
 held together by the formaldehyde cross links.
 Cross links are reversed and the DNA is purified, leaving a 3C 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

library
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Within this library, the frequency with which restriction fragments are
 found ligated together corresponds to their degree of interaction within
 the nucleus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 3C library is a basis for a number of different assays that all measure
 interaction frequencies.
 Traditional 3C uses PCR with primers positioned adjacent to the restriction
 enzyme recognition sites of two loci of interest.
 If a PCR product is detected, these two sequences were physically close
 within the nucleus.
 The strength of bands on a gel can be used to quantify the strength of
 this interaction, and qPCR can be used to accurately assess this for a
 large number of primer pairs (3C qPCR).
 Both of these techniques are used to probe interactions on a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 basis; that is, investigating the interaction between two specific loci
 at a time.

 assay, which is capable of revealing the genome-wide interaction profile
 of a single sequence of interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A biotinylated primer annealing and extension step is used to do this, with
 magnetic streptavidin beads pulling down all ligation products containing
 the sequence of interest, or

\end_inset

bait
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 A second restriction enzyme is then used to cut the enriched library, an
 enzyme with a 4 base pair recognition site is used to cut approximately
 once every 256 base pairs (
\begin_inset Formula $4^{4}=256$
\end_inset

).
 The resulting sticky end is then used to ligate an adapter to the end of
 the unknown partner sequence.
 This allows the libary to be amplified using PCR.
 Primers with overhanging tails are used to add the sequence needed for
 sequencing with the Illumina Genome Analyser IIx.
 A custom sequencing primer is used which binds to the bait region immediately
 before the first restriction enzyme cut site, preventing known sequence
 from being unnecessarily sequenced.
 A few remaining few base pairs are left betweenthe sequencing primer and
 the cut site, to use as a barcode region to allow multiplexing of libraries
 on the sequencing run.
 This sequence is also used to confirm the identity of the bait sequence.
 The remaining base pairs that are sequenced after the cut site are aligned
 to the genome, and their distribution used to plot a genome-wide interaction
 profile for the bait sequence.

\begin_layout Standard
There is mounting evidence that the founder translocations involving 
\emph on
BCR
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
MLL
\emph default
 in leukaemia may occur within the haematopoeitic stem cell compartment
 [#REFS].
 As it is thought that the translocations happen within these cells, it
 is here that I was interested in investigating the organisation of the
 un-translocated genes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the nuclear organisation of these cells starts to change as soon
 as they are removed from the body, it was important that I fixed them with
 formaldehyde as quickly as possible.
 Adding formaldehyde directly to the blood samples would have caused problems
 during cell separation, so I chose to run a Ficoll separation to isolate
 the lymphoblasts, and then fixed in PBS with EDTA and 2% formaldehyde.
 Following formaldehyde separation, I used a magnetic sort with anti-CD34

\end_inset

 antibodies to purify the CD34
\begin_inset script superscript

 cells.
 Finally, I analysed an aliquot of the purified cells using FACS (using
 an antibody against a different epitope of CD34) to find the purity of
 the samples.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first kit I used to separate the fixed CD34
\begin_inset script superscript

 cells was the Invitrogen Dynal CD34 Progenitor Cell Selection System.
 I used this to process 17 separate blood samples from patients who had
 been treated with GCSF to mobilise their haematopoeitic cells into their
 peripheral blood stream.
 The FACS plots all show some material with low front scatter, likely to
 be debris resulting from the fix and sort (Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

).
 This was gated out, and a threshold set for anti-CD34

 fluorescence.
 The percentage of cells within the gate fluorescing above the threshold
 varied from 17% - 91%, with a median purity of 67%.
 10 of 17 samples collected using the Invitrogen kit had to be discarded
 due to unsatisfactory purity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I attempted a number of alterations to the cell separation protocol to improve
 this purity, and finally tried using the Miltenyi MACS CD34 MicroBead Kit
 instead.
 This immediately gave much better performance, with purities ranging from
 90% - 97% with a median of 96% purity (Fig

\begin_layout Section
Restriction Enzyme Choice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The majority of chromosomal translocations within the 
\emph on
BCR
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
MLL
\emph default
 genes occur within tight breakpoint cluster regions.
 The 
\emph on
MLL
\emph default
 breakpoint cluster region is an 8.3 Kb region between exons 6 and 14 bordered
 by two BamHI restriction sites [# REF].
 It is thought that the presence of 8 direct Alu SINE repeats, 4 L1 LINE
 and 2 MER2 repeats within the 
\emph on
MLL
\emph default
 breakpoint cluster region may provide regions of micro-homology with its
 translocation partners and increase the chance of aberrant repair via the
 NHEJ pathway.
 Additionally, a number of putative topoisomerase II binding sites are present
 within this region, leading to suggestions that topoisomerase II activity
 may lead to an increased likelihood of a double strand break in this region.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To provide as accurate a picture of the interaction with these translocation
 forming regions as possible, we looked into the fragments created by a
 number of six-cutting restriction enzymes.
 As the breakpoint cluster region of the 
\emph on
MLL
\emph default
 gene is flanked by BamHI restriction sites, it seemed a natural choice
 for the 3C enzyme.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a number of test e4C runs using Human buffy coat cells it became clear
 that the assay was not working to its full potential.
 Due to the nature of the 3C protocol, the most common interaction partner
 will always be the germ line configuration, as the cut fragments will be
 held together during the ligation reaction, making re-ligation a likely
 possibility.
 This germ line band was clearly visible when the e4C libraries were run
 on a gel (Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BamHI-e4C-Libraries"

\end_inset

), however, the characteristic smear resulting from the varying lengths
 of 3C products was not.

Further tests showed that the underlying problem was poor digestion efficiency
 in the first steps of the 3C, with only 44% of BamHI recognition sites
 being cut

\end_inset

.
 Further work on this step showed that the SDS treatment and subsequent
 Triton-X100 quenching of the SDS were having a dramatic effect on the digestion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I ran a concentration gradient of Triton-X100 with a digestion using purified
 plasmid DNA which showed residual SDS inhibiting the reaction when there
 was insufficient Triton-X100 to quench all of the SDS (Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Restriction-Enzyme-Tests"

\end_inset

A).
 The concentration of Triton-X100 had a similar effect on the digestion
 efficiency of BamHi with cross linked chromatin (Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Restriction-Enzyme-Tests"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I followed these tests with an experiment using a panel of different restriction
 enzymes, some of which are commonly used in 3C based techniques.
 I used cells which were fixed with the normal 2% formaldehyde and a weaker
 1% formaldehyde fix, and I ran the digestion step with and without the
 initial SDS disruption and Triton-X100 quenching (Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Restriction-Enzyme-Tests"

\end_inset

).
 These digestions clearly showed that BamHI was far less efficient at digesting
 cross linked chromatin than the other restriction enzymes in every condition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point, instead of continuing to try to optimise the 3C to work with
 BamHI, I went back to the drawing board and looked at which other enzymes
 could be suitable.
 The restriction enzyme AseI had good performance under all of the conditions,
 and gave suitable fragment sizes in and around the break point cluster
 regions of both 
\emph on
BCR
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
MLL
\emph default
.
 Further digestion efficiency qPCR tests showed it's efficiency at a far
 superior 81 - 99% of sites being cut

\begin_layout Section
Primer Design
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the restriction enzymes for the e4C have been chosen, primers can be
 designed for the assay.
 A suitable bait fragment must be chosen; for my first e4C libraries with
 
\emph on
MLL
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
BCR
\emph default
, I picked 
\emph on
AseI
\emph default
 fragments which lay within the breakpoint cluster regions (hg19 chr22:23,596,60
8-23,612,941 and chr11:118,354,804-118,356,061, respectively).
 Bait fragments should not be excessively large or small, as this can affect
 the ligation efficiency in the generation of the 3C library.
 One end of the bait fragment is used for the e4C, this must be free of
 repetitive DNA, and have enough room to design primers before the first
 
\emph on
NlaIII
\emph default
 restriction site.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three primers are designed for each e4C library: a primer to do the initial
 enrichment step from the 3C library, which must have a biotinylated moiety
 on the 5' base to bind the streptavidin beads; a nested primer which binds
 the bait sequence and has an overhanging tail with the half of the Illumina
 Paired End Adapter 1.0 (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "PE Ad 1.0"
description "Illumina Paired End Adapter 1.0"

\end_inset

PE Ad 1.0); a sequencing primer which aligns with the resulting library sequence,
 close to the 
\emph on
AseI
\emph default
 cut site but leaving a barcode sequence of at least 3 base pairs.
 This bar code region is important - it allows us to multiplex e4C libraries
 to save on sequencing costs, but also confirms that the sequenced fragment
 is the expected bait.
 The sequencing primers were designed to have properties as close to the
 original Illumina sequencing primer as possible, within the constraints
 of the bait region sequence (Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:e4C-sequencing-primer-properties"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Paired end sequencing or single end sequencing?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I started my project, the intention was to use Illumina Paired End
 Sequencing to sequence the libraries.
 I designed primers and adapters so that the first read would be from the
 
\emph on
NlaIII 
\emph default
adapter end of the e4C fragment and would give sequence information about
 the unknown, captured fragment.
 The second read of the paired end run would then go from the bait end of
 the fragment, and confirm the identity of the e4C bait region.
 Dr.
 Cameron Osborne was sequencing mouse e4C libraries and ran into problems
 with this approach however: read lengths were not sufficient to sequence
 through the entire captured region and into the bait sequence on the first
 round of sequencing, so we could not be certain that the first read was
 not from a concatemer, and so not directly ligated to the bait sequence.
 At this time, the sequences of the Illumina sequencing primers were made
 public, and we decided to use our own custom sequencing primers.
 This allowed us to use single end sequencing runs which start very close
 to the ligation junction of the e4C products, so confirming the identity
 of the bait product but giving us enough sequence in the unknown partner
 to be aligned to the genome.

It should be noted that different e4C libraries with different sequencing
 primers can be multiplexed within the same lane.
 However, multiplexing with libraries using the standard Illumina PE Ad
 1.0 sequencing primer is not advised, as this primer also binds the e4C
 library and sequences the bait region.

My initial plans when making the interaction libraries was to incorporate
 a

\end_inset

chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) step to purity for 3C DNA-protein complexes
 containing RNA Polymerase II.
 This was done using an antibody against the Serine-5 phosphorylated elongating
 form of RNA Polymerase II, and was intended to enrich for DNA-DNA interactions
 specifically happening at transcription factories.
 This protocol was used with some success in my lab by Dr.
 Cameron Osborne and Allen Chong, though the extra immunoprecipitation step
 meant that only very low amounts of input DNA was available for the e4C
 stage, resulting in interaction datasets that were very low in complexity.
 This low complexity was offset by the specific nature of the hits and low
 signal to noise ratio (unpublished data).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the chromatin immunoprecipitation steps worked well in my hands
 for test samples, I soon decided to remove this enrichment step in favour
 of keeping as much library DNA as possible.
 I showed by RT-PCR that my bait genes were expressed in the cells I was
 investigating.
 Additionally, all interactions may be relevant to the formation of chromosomal
 translocations, so any resulting interaction data is useful.

 An established technique when using low cell numbers for techniques such
 as ChIP and BS-Seq is to use 'carrier' chromatin to buffer loss of sample
 DNA [#REFS].
 This is done by processing cells from another organism in with the sample,
 giving larger quantities of DNA to work with.
 Loss through non-specific binding of DNA to plastic such as tubes and pipette
 tips has less of an effect on the sample DNA, and steps such as precipitations
 are aided by having larger pellets to work with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Intially I tried this technique by using the Sf9 cell line, derived from
 
\emph on
Spodoptera frugiperda

 (Fall Armyworm), obtained from Maureen Hamon at the Babraham Institute.

 up until the point of permeabilisation.
 Sf9 cells were then split into two aliquots of 1 x 10

 sample cells were added to one aliquot.
 Both samples were then processed as normal for the rest of the 3C protocol.

After this initial test run, I use the Schneider's line 2 (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature

\end_inset

S2R+) cell line, derived from 
\emph on
Drosophila melanogaster
\emph default
, grown with help from Dr.
 Sarah Toscano at the Babraham Institute.
 The reason for this change was because the genome of 
\emph on
Drosophila melanogaster
\emph default
 is known, allowing easy design of PCR primers to test for carrier DNA contamina
tion, and to allow identification of any products occuring as a result of
 a non-specific ligation event in the e4C.
 The protocol was followed as described for the Sf9 cells.
\end_layout

 of sample DNA and successful 3C product detection using primers designed

\begin_layout Section
Multiplexing e4C libraries
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the cost of next generation sequencing is rapidly decreasing, sequencin
g an Illumina library is an expensive process.
 In order to make libraries cheaper, 'multiplexing' is a common practice.
 All multiplexing uses the same principle: Illumina libraries are created
 with a small number of base pairs constant within each sequence - a barcode.
 Multiple libraries with different barcodes are mixed and simultaneously
 sequenced in a single flow cell lane.
 After the sequences are retrieved from the sequencing run, the libraries
 are separated by identifying the barcode present at within each sequence.
 The greater the number of libraries which are multiplexed within a single
 lane, the less the number of reads retrieved for each library.
 In many cases the total number of returned sequences is in excess of what
 is needed, as in the case of my e4C libraries, where a great number of
 duplicates are returned, showing that the full depth of the e4C library
 has been sequenced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A number of variants of multiplexing have been used with the Illumina Genome
 Analyser IIx, and Illumina itself produces a kit for the production of
 multiplexed libraries which uses a short paired-end read.
 Because I was sequencing my e4C libraries with custom sequencing primers,
 I was able to specify the sequence present at the start of each read.
 As such, I designed the sequencing primers to leave a few base pairs for
 sequencing before the 
\emph on
AseI
\emph default
 restriction site.
 This has the dual benefit of allowing the multiplexing of multiple e4C
 libraries with different baits, and ensuring that the sequenced products
 are not the result of unspecific primer binding; genomic sequence is used
 as the barcode which is not incorporated with any primers used.
