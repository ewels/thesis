 I used e4C, a technique based on chromosome conformation capture (3C).
\end_layout

 in mouse foetal liver cells.
 They used ChIP to purify ligation products associated with hyper-phosphorylated
 RNA polymerase II and identified association partners by hybridising the
 e4C library to a microarray.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this project I made a number of modifications to the protocol - I used
 a different cell type, different bait regions, I removed the ChIP step
 (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:ChIP-e4C"

\end_inset

) and I adapted the protocol for use with next generation sequencing analysis
 instead of microarrays.
 In this chapter I discuss that process, the challenges it presented and
 reasons for modifications that I made.

\begin_layout Standard
Chromosome Conformation Capture (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature

\end_inset

3C) is a ligation based proximity assay.
 Developed in 2002 by Dr Job Dekker and colleagues, it allows the physical
 association of chromatin to be interrogated 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 3C has become a key methodology in the field of nuclear organisation and
 the foundation for a range of variant techniques (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Osborne2011"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 3C protocol begins with formaldehyde fixation used to preserve nuclear
 structure.
 A restriction endonuclease is used to cut the DNA, typically recognising
 a 6 base pair sequence cutting on average once every 4 Kb (
\begin_inset Formula $4^{6}=4096$
\end_inset

).
 This results in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hairballs
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of cross linked DNA and protein which are diluted into a large volume.
 A ligation reaction is carried out which favours ligations between sequences
 held together by formaldehyde linkages.
 These cross links are reversed and the DNA is purified, resulting in a
 3C library (Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:3C_protocol"

\end_inset

).
 The frequency with which restriction fragments are found ligated together
 corresponds to the degree of their association within the nucleus.

\begin_layout Standard
Traditional 3C uses PCR with primers positioned adjacent to the restriction
 endonuclease recognition sites of two loci of interest.
 If a PCR product is detected, these two sequences were physically close
 within the nucleus.
 The relative strengths of interactions can be assessed by quantifying intensiti
es of bands on a gel or with RT-qPCR threshold values.
 In this way, interactions can be studied on a one-to-one basis, investigating
 the interaction between two candidate loci.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Enriched 4C
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A 3C library contains fragments representing the interaction frequencies
 of all sequences in the genome.
 Enriched 4C (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "e4C"
description "Enriched Chromosome Conformation Capture"

\end_inset

e4C) purifies all ligation products containing a specific bait (sequence
 of interest) by using a biotinylated primer with annealing and extension
 steps.
 Magnetic streptavidin beads then enrich ligation products containing the
 bait.
 A second restriction enzyme is used to cut the unknown sequence at a 4
 base pair recognition site (approximately once every 256 base pairs: 
\begin_inset Formula $4^{4}=256$
\end_inset

), giving a region of single stranded DNA used to ligate an adapter.
 The resulting e4C library has known sequence at both ends of every fragment
 and can be amplified using PCR (Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:e4C_protocol"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use the e4C library with the Illumina Genome Analyser IIx (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "GAIIx"
description "Illumina Genome Analyser IIx"

\end_inset

GAIIx) next generation sequencing platform, I incorporated a second PCR
 step using primers with overhanging tails.
 This adds the sequences needed for cluster generation with the Illumina
 GA IIx flow cells (Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:e4C_protocol"

\end_inset

).
 Libraries were then purified and quantified using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer
 and TaqMan qPCR before being loaded onto flow cells for cluster generation
 and sequencing.
 To avoid sequencing the known bait sequence with the standard single-end
 Illumina sequencing primer, a custom sequencing primer was used which binds
 to the bait region immediately before the first restriction enzyme cut
 site.
 A few remaining few base pairs were left between the sequencing primer
 and the cut site to use as a barcode region, allowing multiplexing of libraries
 on the a single flow cell lane (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Multiplexing-e4C-libraries"

\end_inset

).
 This sequence is also used to confirm the identity of the bait sequence.
 The remaining base pairs beyond the cut site are aligned to the genome
 and their distribution used to plot a genome-wide interaction profile for
 the bait sequence.

\begin_layout Section
3C Restriction Enzyme Choice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step in designing an e4C experiment is the choice of a bait region
 and six-cutting restriction endonuclease.
 This enzyme defines the 3C fragments to be ligated and the position of
 the bait sequence to be enriched.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The majority of chromosomal translocations within the 
\emph on
BCR

\emph on

 genes occur within tight breakpoint cluster regions.
 The 
\emph on
MLL

 by two 
\emph on

\emph default
 restriction sites 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, making this a natural choice for the primary 3C restriction endonuclease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After a number of test e4C runs using human buffy coat cells it became clear
 that the assay was not working to its full potential.
 When run on a gel e4C libraries should appear as a smear due to the range
 of different restriction fragments ligated to the bait sequence (eg.
 Mouse 
\emph on
HindIII
\emph default
 e4C library, Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BamHI-e4C-Libraries"

\end_inset

).
 Bands are sometimes visible due to the germ line sequences being the most
 common ligation products, removed at a later state by digestion with a
 rare-cutting restriction endonuclease.
 In my human 
\emph on
BamHI
\emph default
 e4C libraries the germ line band was visible but little or no smear was
 present (Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Standard
The lack of a smear could be the result of a number of factors - inefficient
 PCR amplification; loss of library through purification steps; inefficient
 enrichment of bait; low ligation efficiency in 3C or adapter ligation or
 poor digestion in initial 3C and e4C four cutter digestion steps.
 I ran a series of diagnostic tests to identify the cause, including a digestion
 efficiency assay which quantifies the amount of PCR product produced by
 primers spanning a restriction endonuclease recognition site (see Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "sub:M&M-3C-digestion-efficiency-analysis"

 for method).
 This showed that only 44% of

\begin_layout Standard
The steps immediately before the 
\emph on
BamHI
\emph default
 digestion in the protocol include an SDS treatment to permeabilise the
 fixed nuclei to aid access for the restriction enzyme, followed by treatment
 with Triton-X100 to quench the SDS.
 To test if the SDS was inhibiting 
\emph on
BamHI
\emph default
 digestion, I digested purified plasmid DNA after SDS treatment and a range
 of Triton-X100 concentrations (Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:BamHI-TritonX100"

\end_inset

 A).
 This showed that 
\emph on
BamHI
\emph default
 digestion is inhibited if the SDS is not adequately sequestered.
 To test the effect of an increased Triton-X100 concentration in fixed nuclei
 I prepared human buffy coat cells as described in the e4C protocol (Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 digestions after treatment with SDS and two Triton-X100 concentrations
 (Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 The nuclei treated with the higher concentration of Triton-X100 showed
 a higher digestion efficiency, though still unsatisfactory for e4C.

Primer Design

\begin_layout Subsection
Paired end sequencing or single end sequencing?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When I started my project, the intention was to use Illumina Paired End
 Sequencing to sequence the libraries.
 I designed primers and adapters so that the first read would be from the
 
\emph on
NlaIII 
\emph default
adapter end of the e4C fragment and would give sequence information about
 the unknown, captured fragment.
 The second read of the paired end run would then go from the bait end of
 the fragment, and confirm the identity of the e4C bait region.
 However, Dr Cameron Osborne was sequencing mouse e4C libraries and ran
 into problems with this approach: read lengths were not sufficient to sequence
 through the entire captured region and into the bait sequence on the first
 round of sequencing, so we could not be certain that the first read was
 not from a ligation concatemer and not directly ligated to the bait sequence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this time, the sequences of the Illumina sequencing primers were made
 public, so we decided to design our own sequencing primers.
 This allowed us to use single end sequencing runs which start very close
 to the ligation junction of the e4C products, confirming the identity of
 the bait product but giving us enough sequence in the unknown partner to
 be aligned to the genome.
 Sequencing primers were designed to be as similar in their length, T

 and GC content as the official Illumina Sequencing Primer 1.0 (Table

\begin_layout Subsection
Bait specific primers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A number of bait-specific primers need to be designed for each e4C library:
 an extension primer, a first round PCR primer with an overhanging tail
 consisting of half the Illumina Paired End Adapter 1.0 (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "PE Ad 1.0"
description "Illumina Paired End Adapter 1.0"

\end_inset

PE Ad 1.0) and a sequencing primer complementary to the library bait sequence.
 The sequencing primer must anneal close to the restriction endonuclease
 cut site but leaving a barcode sequence of at least 3 base pairs.
 This bar code region is important - it allows us to multiplex e4C libraries
 (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Multiplexing-e4C-libraries"

\end_inset

) and confirms that the sequenced fragment is the expected bait - it is
 not present in any primers so must result from original genomic sequence.

I attempted a number of alterations to the cell separation protocol to improve
 this purity, one of which was the use of the Miltenyi MACS CD34 MicroBead
 Kit.
 This immediately gave much better performance, with purities ranging from
 90% - 97% with a median of 96% purity (typical FACS plot shown in Fig

Initially, CD34

 of apheresis coordinator / specialist nurse Paul Boraks (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Samples were collected on a weekly basis before being fixed and sorted
 as described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:M&M-CD34-cell-handling"

\end_inset

.
 Typically, between 12 and 30 ml whole blood was received in each sample,

 Between 2008 and 2009 I managed to collect and sort 23 peripheral blood
 samples, giving a total of 1.04 x 10
\begin_inset script superscript

 total cells, however 10 of these samples had to be discarded due to poor
 purity (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 This left me with 13 samples and a total of 7 x 10

 cells (minimum 76% purity, average 91.6% purity).
 Because of this low cell number I worked on optimising the 3C protocol
 for use with low cell numbers.

 time.

I had originally hoped to incorporate a

\end_inset

chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) step to purify 3C complexes containing
 RNA polymerase II, enriching for chromatin interactions at transcription
 factories.
 This protocol was used with some success in my lab by Dr Cameron Osborne
 and Allen Chong, though the immunoprecipitation step meant that little
 3C material was available for the e4C stage resulting in interaction datasets
 that were very low in complexity.
 This was offset to some degree by the specific nature of the hits and low
 signal to noise ratio (unpublished data).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the chromatin immunoprecipitation steps worked well in my hands
 with test mouse B cell samples, I soon decided to remove this enrichment
 step in favour of keeping as much library DNA as possible due to the scarcity

 An established technique when using low cell numbers for methods such as
 ChIP and MeDIP is to use 'carrier' chromatin to buffer loss of sample DNA
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "O'Neill2006,Ficz2011"

\end_inset

.
 This is done by processing cells or DNA from another organism in with the
 sample, giving larger quantities of DNA to work with.
 Loss through non-specific binding to plastic such as tubes and pipette
 tips has less of an effect on the sample DNA and steps such as precipitations
 are aided by having larger pellets to work with.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I started using this technique with the Sf9 cell line derived from 
\emph on

 Cells were processed in parallel with the sample as described in Section

, up until the point of permeabilisation.
 Sf9 cells were then split into two aliquots of 1 x 10

 The reason for this change was because the genome of

tion and allowing identification of any products occurring as a result of
 a non-specific ligation events in the e4C.

\begin_layout Standard
Although the cost of next generation sequencing is rapidly decreasing, sequencin
g an Illumina library is an expensive process.
 In order to make libraries cheaper, multiplexing is a common practice.
 All multiplexing uses the same principle: Illumina libraries are created
 with a small number of base pairs constant within each sequence - a barcode.
 Multiple libraries with different barcodes are mixed and simultaneously
 sequenced in a single flow cell lane.
 After the sequences are retrieved from the sequencing run, the libraries
 are separated by identifying the barcode present at within each sequence.
 The greater the number of libraries which are multiplexed within a single
 lane, the fewer the reads retrieved for each library.
 The total number of returned sequences is often in excess of what is needed,
 as in the case of my e4C libraries where a great number of duplicates are
 returned, showing that the full depth of the e4C library has been sequenced.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A number of variants of multiplexing have been used with the Illumina Genome
 Analyser IIx and Illumina itself produces a kit for the production of multiplex
ed libraries which uses a short paired-end read.
 Because I was sequencing my e4C libraries with custom sequencing primers,
 I was able to specify the sequence present at the start of each read.
 As such, I designed the sequencing primers to leave a few base pairs for
 sequencing before the 
\emph on
AseI
\emph default
 restriction site.
 This has the dual benefit of allowing the multiplexing of multiple e4C
 libraries with different baits, and ensuring that the sequenced products
 are not the result of unspecific primer binding; genomic sequence is used
 as the barcode which is not incorporated with any primers used.

 These libraries are known as

 Run 1 for the rest of this thesis.
 Once the raw reads were available from the sequencing run, we separated

\emph on

\emph default
 (for details, see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 Despite loading equimolar amounts of both libraries and sequencing primers
 onto the flow cell, the 
\emph on

\emph default
 library only returned 55,868 reads vs.
 the 
\emph on
BCR
\emph default
 library with 22,390,498, a 400-fold difference.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Reasons for the bias
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several possible reasons for such a bias occurring with the multiplexe
d libraries.
 Quantitation of the libraries could be inaccurate with DNA present without
 Illumina sequencing adapters.
 Similarly, there could be a problem with the 
\emph on
MLL 
\emph default
library causing it to bind to the flow cell or create clusters inefficiently.
 Both of these seem unlikely however, as the e4C libraries were quantified
 using quantitative real-time PCR using fluorescent TaqMan probes which
 only fluoresce when bound to the Illumina adapter sequences.
 Additionally, the 
\emph on
MLL 
\emph default
Run 2 e4C library that was sequenced without multiplexing on its own lane
 generated clusters as expected by its concentration and returned the expected
 number of reads.
 Differences in the sequencing chemistry related to the sequencing primers
 could cause the 
\emph on
BCR
\emph default
 library to sequence more efficiently than the 
\emph on
MLL
\emph default
 library, but that would presumably not give a greater number of 
\emph on
BCR 
\emph default
library clusters, generated using the same Illumina adapters for both libraries.
 The total number of reads returned from the multiplexed lanes were equivalent
 to those returned from single library lanes, however, indicating that there
 were more 
\emph on
BCR
\emph default
 library clusters than 
\emph on
MLL
\emph default
.

 an equal number of reads.
 This time, the

 library returned 9,960,249 reads and the 
\emph on

\begin_layout Standard
Upon initial analysis of the multiplexed 
\emph on
BCR 
\emph default
Run 2 and 
\emph on
MLL 
\emph default

 reads present within the

\emph on
BCR
\emph default
 library.
 There is significant enrichment around the 
\emph on
BCR

A) with a familiar drop off interaction associated with

 Interestingly, an equivalent enrichment around the

\emph on

 e4C library (Figure

 Crossover reads typically had few duplicates, whereas suspected genuine
 reads were present in high numbers.
 A similar effect was seen in in mouse ChIP-e4C libraries prepared and sequenced
 using different baits (unpublished data).

 Although competition with the standard Illumina sequencing primer meant
 that the majority of

library reads were of the bait sequence, enough reads were returned to carry
 out some analysis.
 As can be seen in Figure

, the 
\emph on

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After removing the two bait chromosomes 11 and 22 and removing all duplicate
 reads, I analysed the hit 
\emph on

fragments between libraries.
 The multiplexed 
\emph on
MLL 
\emph default
library had a correlation of 0.656 with the multiplexed 
\emph on
BCR 
\emph default
library and a correlation of 0.36 with the 
\emph on
MLL 
\emph default
phiX library.
 If a threshold of 20 reads was set before removal of duplicate reads, these
 two correlations became 0.009 and 0.782, respectively.
 This demonstrates that only a small number of reads are crossing over between
 libraries, as can be seen in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Crossover-reads"

.
 Unfortunately this threshold was chosen empirically and could lead to inaccurat
e analysis results.
 As such, the thresholded library was not used for further analysis.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Reasons for crossover reads
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It seems likely that these crossover reads result from an error in the cluster
 identification during the Illumina sequencing process.
 We approached Illumina with out observations but received no satisfactory
 response.
 Because we could not address this problem without a known cause, we did
 not multiplex any further e4C libraries.

Due to the low coverage of the e4C libraries (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Barcoded 
\emph on
NlaIII
\emph default
 adapter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In an attempt to retain quantitative data about the frequency of 3C ligation
 products before the PCR steps, I designed a new 
\emph on
NlaIII
\emph default
 adapter which included 4 base pairs of unspecified sequence in the oligo
 to use as a barcode.
 The idea behind this new adapter was to use it in a paired end Illumina
 sequencing run.
 Read one would use the same custom sequencing primer and methodology as
 that described above for the single end sequenced e4C libraries.
 The second read would use the standard Illumina sequencing primer two,
 which would read through the barcode and into the unknown sequence.
 The barcode could be used to deconvolute quantitative information about
 the number of pre-PCR 3C ligation products, and the unknown sequence would
 provide additional validation of the ligation product.
 Every pre-PCR 3C product should give two different barcodes from the two
 strands of random barcode, which could then be quantified to give ligation
 frequencies and greater coverage information.
 This approach should allow the e4C data to be treated quantitatively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to ensure that the two single stranded oligos would hybridise to
 form a functional adapter, I added a 6 base pair GC-clamp after the barcode
 before the 
\emph on
NlaIII
\emph default
 sticky end (Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Barcoded-NlaIII-adapter"

\end_inset

).
 After the first round of PCR, the barcode will have a complementary sequence,
 so the initially different bases should not cause any problems in the sequencin
g.

Multiplexing same-bait e4C libraries

\begin_layout Standard
The high number of duplicates seen for every read in the e4C libraries (Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Duplicate-reads"

\end_inset

) suggests that there is a lack of complexity in the e4C libraries, and
 we were sequencing the full depth of the libraries.
 In an effort to increase the diversity in a sequencing run, I created eight
 e4C libraries using the 
\emph on
BCR
\emph default
 breakpoint region bait and the new 
\emph on
NlaIII
\emph default
 adapter described above.
 The e4C libraries were prepared as biological replicates from new CD34

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whilst multiplexing e4C libraries with different bait regions in a single
 Illumina lane caused crossover reads which skewed downstream analysis,
 any crossover reads between libraries sharing the same bait would not affect
 analysis.
 Combined with the new 
\emph on
NlaIII
\emph default
 adapter able to identify unique 3C ligation products, such multiplexing
 should not suffer the same problems as previous runs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Results of e4C modifications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to test the e4C protocol modifications described above, I spiked
 a small amount of the multiplexed e4C libraries with the new 
\emph on
NlaIII
\emph default
 adapter into the phiX control lane on an Illumina GAIIx sequencing run.
 Despite loading a high concentration of the custom sequencing primer, a
 large proportion of the reads came from the standard Illumina sequencing
 primer and consisted of 
\emph on
BCR
\emph default
 bait sequence.
 111,897 clusters were returned with the expected read 1.
 Of these clusters only 2,541 (2.27%) had a second paired end read with the
 expected structure (barcode, GC clamp, 
\emph on
NlaIII
\emph default
 site, unknown).
 The remaining reads were instead either 
\emph on
NlaIII
\emph default
 site > GC clamp > 
\emph on
NlaIII
\emph default
 site (4,394 - 3.93%); 
\emph on
NlaIII
\emph default
 site but no clamp (102,284 - 91.41%); or something else (2678 - 2.39%).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To try to find out why the paired end reads did not conform to the expected
 structure, we analysed all paired end reads from bait clusters irrespective
 of their sequencing primer in read 1.
 Over 2.7 million began with the 
\emph on
NlaIII
\emph default
 recognition site 
\family typewriter
CATG
\family default
.
 Of these, the majority had very similar sequences.
 Most of these were not mappable to the human genome and a number of the
 highly represented reads mapped to the 
\emph on
NlaIII
\emph default
 adapter.
 The presence of these reads suggests that there were problems with either
 the oligo hybridisation used to anneal the 
\emph on
NlaIII
\emph default
 adapter or the ligation reaction used to ligate the adapter to the 3C library.
 Both of these problems could be exacerbated by the presence of the non-homologo
us barcode region.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to the problems with the barcoded adapter, the second read from the
 paired end run was not reliable.
 The low numbers of reads from read 1 meant that this e4C sequencing run
 did not yield any useful information in its own right.
 Because of time and money constraints I did not continue the development
 of this modification.
 Had I the chance, I would use one 
\emph on
NlaIII
\emph default
 barcode per e4C library.
 This would hopefully remove problems caused by non-homologous sequence
 and although losing the ability to differentiate between individual ligation
 products it would keep the ability to differentiate between separate e4C
 libraries multiplexed on a single flow cell.
 This approach would increase both coverage depth and give some degree of
 quantitative information in the association data.
