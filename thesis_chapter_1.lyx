\begin_layout Chapter
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The nucleus is a highly complex organelle responsible for the faithful replicati
on and maintenance of the DNA template and regulation of its transcriptional
 products.
 To achieve this, the contents of the nucleus are organised into compartments
 specialising in processes such as transcription and replication.
 Abnormalities in the organisation of the nucleus are often associated with
 diseases such as cancer.
 In this chapter I will discuss the current understanding of nuclear structure
 and organisation and how it may be involved in the initiation of oncogenic
 chromosomal translocations.

\begin_layout Section
Nuclear compartmentalisation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because the nuclear interior is devoid of membrane bound structures its
 organisation is defined by a dynamic equilibrium - a sum product of the
 many processes and requirements involved in nuclear biology.
 The organisation of DNA within the nucleus is tied to the organisation
 of the nuclear proteome and together they control all nuclear processes.
 A number of nuclear proteins are found in aggregates typically referred
 to as subnuclear compartments.
 The clustering of proteins into compartments increases the efficiency of
 biochemical processes and is predicted by the principle of molecular crowding
 (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Cook2002"

\end_inset

) and is a key feature in the organisation of the nucleus.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The largest subcompartment found in the mammalian nucleus is the nucleolus.
 The only subcompartment to be visible with light microscopy alone, the
 nucleolus is formed by the clustering of ribosomal RNA gene clusters known
 as Nucleolar Organising Regions (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "NOR"
description "Nucleolar organising region"

\end_inset

NORs) and facilitates efficient transcription of these genes by RNA polymerase
 I.
 The colocalisation of the template genes with the transcriptional machinery
 allows rapid and efficient cycling of the polymerases as well as the assembly
 with ribosomal proteins (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Pederson2011"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A large number of other protein subcompartments exist, some whose function
 have not been fully characterised.
 Many have been associated with nuclear processes such as silencing (PcG
 bodies) and transcription (transcription factories).
 The organisation of the genome is directed in part to access these subcompartme
nts (reviewed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Osborne2008"

).
 Transcription factories are discussed in detail in Section

\begin_layout Section
Chromatin
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chromatin is a general term used to describe DNA packaged around histone
 proteins to form nucleosomes, and the plethora of additional proteins that
 bind to them both.
 There are two principle forms of chromatin: euchromatin
\emph on
 
\emph default
and heterochromatin.
 These were first described in the early twentieth century due to their
 differential staining with carmine acetic acid within the nucleus 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Heitz1928"

\end_inset

.
 Heterochromatin stains darkly with giemsa stains because it remains highly
 condensed during interphase and often associated with the nuclear periphery.
 Constitutive heterochromatin consists of repetitive elements found in centromer
es and telomeres, it plays a structural role within the genome and is highly
 compacted during interphase.
 Facultative heterochromatin is less compact and consists of inactive chromatin
 that can vary between cell types as they differentiate.
 Heterochromatin is well known as being a repressive environment for gene
 expression.
 An example of this is the position-effect variegation seen in 
\emph on
Drosophila melanogaster - 
\emph default
a chromosomal inversion in the X chromosome characterised in the early 1930s
 can place the 
\emph on
white
\emph default
 gene close to pericentric heterochromatin, leading to the spreading of
 heterochromatin marks which silences the 
\emph on
white 
\emph default
gene and results in a change in eye colour 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Vogel2009"

\end_inset

.
 In contrast, euchromatin is the site of most genic transcription 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Chesterton1974"

\end_inset

, its looser compaction allowing cellular machinery access to the DNA, enabling
 the binding of transcription factors and the initiation of transcription.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differences between heterochromatin and euchromatin lie within the proteins
 that they contain.
 Chromatin acts as a platform for proteins to bind to.
 Differences in histone modifications, histone variants, nucleosome packing
 and DNA modifications affect the accessibility and binding profile of the
 chromatin and can control how the sequences within are used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Histones
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To package DNA, the double helix is wrapped around an octamer of core histones:
 two H2A, two H2B, two H3 and two H4.
 146 base pairs of DNA interact with these positively charged proteins to
 form the nucleosome, which is then bound by histone H1 with linker DNA
 to make a total of 166 base pairs (Fig 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:nucleosome-xray-structure"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "Davey2002"

\end_inset

).
 This packing forms the 10 nm fibre, often known as 'beads on a string'
 due to its appearance in electron micrographs.
 At their most basic level, histones function to compact DNA by counteracting
 the negative charge of the phosphorylated back bone.

\begin_layout Subsection
Histone modifications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Core histones have flexible amino-terminal tails which extend outside of
 the nucleosome, and are accessible to proteins within the nucleoplasm.
 These tails can be post-translationally modified at a large number of residues
 - lysine (methylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, ADP-Ribosylati
on), arginine (methylation) as well as serine and threonine (phosphorylation).
 These modifications can affect the packing of chromatin 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Wolffe1999a"

\end_inset

 as well as which proteins can bind.
 The large number of combinatorial possibilities that result from these
 modifications have been dubbed the 'Histone Code' 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Strahl2000a"

\end_inset

.
 Different modifications are related to different chromatin states.
 For example, active promoters are typically enriched for di- and tri-methylatio
n of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) whilst inactive promoters are enriched for
 trimethylation at lysine residues 27 (H3K27me3) and 9 (H3K9me3) (See table

As chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) has become a common laboratory technique
, combined with microarray techniques (ChIP on chip) and next generation
 sequencing (ChIP-Seq), our understanding of how histone modifications affect
 chromatin biology on a genome-wide scale has advanced dramatically.
 Profiling chromatin types using multiple datasets covering a large number
 of histone modifications is sufficient to predict the identity and function
 of regions in the genome with a high degree of accuracy, revealing previously
 unknown enhancers

In addition to histone tail modifications, chromatin can be modified by
 the incorporation of histone variants.
 Canonical core histone genes are found in clustered repeat arrays within

The first study to suggest that eukaryotic transcription does not take place
 with a processive RNA polymerase moving along a DNA template was by Jackson,

 They showed that nascent RNA transcripts labelled with [

The discovery of transcription factories has demanded a new model for the
 action of RNA polymerase II 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Cook1999"

\end_inset

.
 The revised model proposes that instead of RNA polymerase II freely diffusing
 to active genes and tracking along the gene body, genes are recruited to
 transcription factories and are pulled through a stationary polymerase.
 Such a model provides a better explanation for the mechanics of transcription
 - clustering of transcriptional activity may enable the cell to conduct
 transcription in a much more efficient manner; HeLa nuclei have a 1 ÂµM
 concentration of active RNA polymerase II, whereas the local concentration
 within transcription factories is closer to 1 mM 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Cook2002"

\end_inset

 Additionally, a polymerase enzyme moving along a gene would rotate with
 the helix of the DNA wrapping the nascent transcript around the template.
 Genes pulled through static transcription factories would extrude their
 RNA transcripts into the nucleoplasm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Importantly, this study showed that there are more transcribing units than
 there are foci of transcription, suggesting that genes must colocalise
 to transcribe.
 The number of transcription factories varies a great deal amongst cell
 types, but the observation that genes colocalise within transcription factories
 has been confirmed by a number of different techniques.

Specialised transcription factories
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After the demonstration that genes share transcription factories, a number
 of groups postulated that specific genes may colocalise at a subset of
 transcription factories.
 The self-organising principle applied to transcription factories would
 predict this; just as the local concentration of active RNA polymerase
 II is elevated by the clustering of transcribing units, the local concentration
 of transcription factors that bind to those transcribed units will also
 be elevated 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 It is thought that genes diffusing to a transcription factory already engaged
 with other genes that share the same factors are more likely to engage
 and be transcribed themselves

 parallel allowing a far higher rate of data collection.

 used 5C, a many-to-many technique that uses a panel of oligonucleotides
 with common adapters to anneal to 3C products and create a library capable
 of being sequenced.
 They sequenced libraries from three ENCODE cell lines: K562, HeLa-S3 and
 GM12878.
 Only a small proportion of the looping interactions uncovered were shared
 between the three cell types, with approximately 60% of interactions being
 unique to a single cell line.
 The majority of TSS looping interactions could be classified as interacting
 with enhancer elements, promoters or regions bound by the structural protein
 CTCF.
 Looping interactions with enhancer elements were significantly enriched
 for actively expressed TSS, demonstrating the importance of three-dimensional
 chromatin contacts in the regulation of gene expression.

When seen as a whole, many of the models described above are not mutually
 exclusive.
 Many hold in common the presence of chromatin loops within the nucleus
 and describe domains of chromatin defined by epigenetic marks.
 It seems entirely plausible that the overall structure of the nucleus is
 determined by the combined result of many different processes directing
 specific interactions, driven by different processes and stabilised by
 different types of contact.

Chromosomal translocations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One of the major medical implications of genomic organisation is how it
 may relate to the formation of chromosomal translocations.
 Specific chromosomal rearrangements are frequently associated with certain
 cancer types, and can be highly predictive of patient prognosis.
 Furthermore, cancers involving different translocations can respond to
 treatments in different ways, paving the way for patient-specific treatment
 regimes (reviewed in

 Understanding the principles of chromosomal translocation formation is
 an important step in the development of novel treatments.

\begin_layout Subsection
Formation of chromosomal translocations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the development of chromosome banding microscopy, it has been known
 that the genetic material within cancerous cells is frequently disrupted.
 Chromosomal translocations involve the rearrangement of genetic material
 between non-homologous chromosomes through the formation and aberrant repair
 of at least two double strand breaks (
\begin_inset CommandInset nomenclature
LatexCommand nomenclature
symbol "DSB"
description "Double strand break"

\end_inset

DSBs) that are situated on different chromosomes.
 The resulting product can be a straight swap (balanced translocations)
 or can result in deletions or even gain of material after malsegregation
 in mitosis (unbalanced translocations).
 Chromosomal translocations can involve multiple DSBs on different chromosomes
 resulting in hugely complex karyotypes, especially in cells predisposed
 to translocations due to defects in repair.

 HR is primarily active during cell replication and rarely leads to serious

DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors are commonly used as chemotherapeutic agents
 and work by decreasing the ligation rate, disrupting the cleavage / ligation
 equilibrium.
 This leads to an increase in DNA cleavage and an accumulation of DSBs,
 triggering the cell DNA damage response and leading to cell death by apoptosis

Breakage first and contact first models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a chromosomal translocation to form, two double strand breaks must exist
 simultaneously and be adjacent in three-dimensional space.
 Two models have been described to explain how DSBs may meet in the nucleus
 â€“ the breakage first model and the contact first model.
 The breakage first model states that DSBs can form anywhere and are able
 to freely diffuse in the nuclear space.
 They undergo large scale movement through the nucleus until they meet and
 are joined.
 The contact first model states that the two DSBs form in sequences already
 close to each other within the nuclear space, therefore large scale chromatin
 movements are not required for the two breaks to meet.

\begin_layout Section
Thesis overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our understanding of nuclear architecture and organisation has developed
 rapidly in the last twenty years, in concert with the development of techniques
 allowing ever larger and less biased studies.
 Correlations have been found between the organisation of specific chromosomes
 and gene loci and their propensity to form chromosomal translocations which
 can lead to oncogenesis.
 A limitation of many of these studies is their scope: either they describe
 the gross organisation of chromosomes and large genomic features, or they
 describe the association of specific loci.
 Gross nuclear organisation is valuable in determining global rules and
 patterns of genomic organisation, but lacks the resolution needed to study
 specific loci.
 Studying the positions of individual genes is also useful, but limited
 to the study of anticipated associations, leading to candidate choice bias.

Chapter four describes my subsequent development of analysis tools and technique
s which I use to understand the sequencing data.
 At the time this work was carried out, such genome-wide interaction datasets
 were being produced for the first time and a great deal of exploration
 was required in order to find useful forms of analysis which could provide
 accurate and unbiased representations of the association data.
 In this chapter I describe a number of steps developed to normalise biases
 and analyse the data, several of which can be found in parallel studies
 published during the same period.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In chapter five I describe the initial analysis of association data from
 the three genes, which exhibit a common association with actively transcribed
 regions of the genome.
 This analysis is feasible due to the availability of a number of publicly
 accessible datasets describing the binding profiles of RNA polymerase,
 histone modifications and abundance of transcripts.
 The patterns I uncover support similar findings by other groups showing
 the separation of the genome into active and inactive compartments.
