Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
The nucleus of a human cell contains approximately 2 metres of DNA 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, requiring a huge degree of compaction to fit within the nucleus.
 In addition to storing DNA the nucleus itself is a highly functional organelle,
 responsible for the huge variety of complex cellular processes.
 To achieve this, the contents of the nucleus are very precisely organised
 into sub-nuclear compartments which specialise in processes such as transcripti
on and replication.
 In addition to the organisation of the nuclear proteome, chromatin itself
 is thought to be organised.
 In this chapter I will discuss the current understanding of nuclear structure
 and organisation, how we have obtained this knowledge, and how it may play
 a part in the initiation of certain cancers.

Chromatin
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chromatin is a general term used to describe the DNA found in the nucleus
 along with the plethora of proteins that bind to it.
 There are two principle forms of chromatin: 
\emph on
euchromatin 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
heterochromatin
\emph default
.
 These were first described in the early twentieth century by the difference
 in staining within the nucleus

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Heterochromatin stains darkly because it remains highly condensed during
 interphase, typically relocating to the nuclear periphery.
 can be split into 
\emph on
constitutive heterochromatin
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
facultative heterochromatin
\emph default
; the former describing heterochromatin found in all cell types typically
 containing repetitive elements found in centromeres and telomeres; the
 latter describing less compacted inactive chromatin which may vary between
 cell types as they differentiate.
 Heterochromatin is well known as being a repressive environment for gene
 expression; studies whereby normally active regions are artificially tethered
 to the inner nuclear membrane show the ablation of gene expression

 Its looser compaction allows access to the DNA by the cellular machinery;
 enabling the binding of transcription factors and the initiation of transcripti
on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differences between heterochromatin and euchromatin lie within the proteins
 that they contain.
 Chromatin acts as a platform for proteins to bind to, differences in histone
 modifications, variants, nucleosome packing and DNA modifications affect
 the accessibility and binding profile of the chromatin, and so how the
 DNA is interpreted by the cell.

To package DNA, the double helix is wrapped around an octomer of core histones:
 two H2A, two H2B, two H3 and two H4.
 146 base pairs of DNA wrap around these positively charged proteins to
 form the nucleosome, which is then bound by histone H1 with linker DNA
 to make a total of 166 base pairs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This packing forms the 10 nm fibre, often known as 'beads on a string'
 due to its appearance in electron micrographs.
 At their most basic level, histones function to compact DNA by counteracting
 the negative charge of the phosphorylated back bone.

Histone modifications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Core histones have flexible tails which extend outside of the nucleosome,
 and are accessible to proteins within the nuclear matrix.
 These tails can be post-translationally modified at a large number of residues
 and these modifications can affect the packing of chromatin

 The large number of combinatorial possibilities that result result from
 these modifications have been dubbed the 'Histone Code' 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Strahl2000a"

\end_inset

, different modifications are related to different chromatin states: for
 example, active promoters are typically enriched for di- and tri-methylation
 of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4), inactive promoters for H3K27me3 and H3K9me3

As chromatin immunoprecipitation (

 techniques (ChIP on chip) and next generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq), our
 understanding of how these marks affect chromatin biology on a genome-wide
 scale has advanced dramatically.
 Profiling chromatin types using multiple datasets covering a large number
 of histone modifications is sufficient to predict the identity and function
 of regions in the genome with a high degree of accuracy, revealing previously
 unknown enhancers

Histone variants
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to histone tail modifications, chromatin can be modified by
 the incorporation of histone variants.
 Canonical core histone genes are found in clustered repeat arrays within
 the genome, are transcribed during replication and are extremely tightly
 conserved between species.
 Histone variants are found as single genes spread through the genome, and
 are subject to far greater diversity

CENP-A is a human variant of histone H3 which replaces the canonical histone
 in centromeric heterochromatin.
 It is a key factor in the establishment of the centromeres and kinetochores
 required for mitosis.
 The histone variant is incorporated with the help of a number of chaperone
 proteins, including HJURP, after replication of DNA has finished 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 CENP-A is essential for the formation of centromeres.

Another frequent histone variant found in humans is H3.3, which differs from
 canonical H3 by just four amino acids 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 They found ridges to be gene-dense, highly transcribed, have a high GC
 content and low LINE repeat density.
 These features are based purely on the underlying sequence content and
 so do not vary amongst cell types.
 The different ridges and anti-ridges were found to contain different classes
 of genes, with weakly expressed genes clustering within anti-ridges and
 clusters of highly expressed housekeeping genes found predominantly in
 ridges

Whilst the two-dimensional organisation of the genome cannot completely
 explain the degree of complexity found with transcriptional control, these
 studies demonstrate that the order of sequence within the genome is not

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The revised model proposes that instead of RNA Polymerase II freely diffusing
 to active genes and tracking along the gene body, it is the genes that
 are recruited to transcription factories and the genes that track through
 a stationary polymerase.
 Such a model provides a better explanation for the mechanics of transcription
 - clustering of transcriptional activity may enable the cell to conduct
 transcription in a much more efficient manner; HeLa nuclei have a 1 ÂµM
 concentration of active RNA Polymerase II, whereas the local concentration
 within transcription factories is closer to 1 mM

 The self-organising principle applied to transcription factories would

\begin_layout Standard
The term leukaemia describes cancers of the blood or bone marrow, caused
 by an over-proliferation of one or more types of white blood cell.
 Leukaemia symptoms usually result from a drop in the production of other
 cell types in the bone marrow; additionally the leukaemic cells are usually
 unable to mount an immune response.
 Uncontrolled growth of different cell types gives different phenotypes,
 and there are a number of leukaemia subclasses that describe these.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL) is a form of leukaemia defined by the
 uncontrolled proliferation of lymphoblasts, precursors to lymphocytes which
 differentiate into B cells, T cells and NK cells.
 ALL was estimated to account for approximately 12% of all leukaemia cases
 in the US in 2008 with around five and a half thousand cases occurring
 annually.
 ALL is the most common form of cancer in children aged under fourteen [47].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Acute Myeloid Leukaemia (AML) is a cancer of the myeloid lineages of blood
 cells.
 AML was responsible for approximately 30% of all cases of leukaemia in
 the US for 2008, and has a higher mortality rate than ALL (66% and 27%
 mortality for AML and ALL, respectively) [47].
 The incidence of AML increases with age, the median age of AML diagnosis
 between 2002 and 2006 in the US was 67 years, and the median age of mortality
 was 72 [48].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, the phenotypic typing of acute leukaemia is not always clear.
 Chromosomal translocations within band q23 of chromosome 11 have been implicate
d in both AML and ALL.
 The gene involved in this translocation was identified by Ziemin-van der
 Poel et al.
 in 1991 and named MLL (Myeloid/Lymphoid Leukaemia, or Mixed Lineage Leukaemia)
 [49].
 In 2002, Armstrong et al.
 showed that acute lymphoblastic leukaemias containing a translocation within
 the MLL gene have a unique expression profile that is different to ALL
 and AML, and suggests an origin within a less committed progenitor cell
 which can produce cells in both the myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages,
 giving a biphenotypic leukaemia (see Figure 8) [50].
 They stated that these leukaemias are substantially different from AML
 and ALL and deserve a new, distinct, class of leukaemia called Mixed Lineage
 Leukaemia (MLL).
 The leukaemic cells in MLL express cell surface antigens normally present
 on both myeloid and lymphoid cells, such as CD14 and CD19 [51].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The work by Armstrong et al adds to existing evidence suggesting that MLL
 and some cases of ALL and AML are initiated specifically within undifferentiate
d haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) [52, 53].
 Haematopoietic stem cells are present within the CD34+ progenitor cell
 population, accounting for approximately 3% of normal human bone marrow
 and 0.3 to 0.5% of human cord blood mononuclear cells [44].
 They are long lived and capable of self-renewal, differentiating into lineage
 restricted progenitors and eventually mature terminally differentiated
 white blood cells (Figure 8).
 HSCs are necessary for the long term maintenance of the haematopoietic
 system and are commonly used to repopulate bone marrow after myeloablative
 therapy, as well as in the treatment of a number of other disorders such
 as autoimmune, cardiac and vascular diseases [54].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The initiation of these leukaemias within a stem cell population is in line
 with our increasing understanding of cancer stem cells, shown to be present
 in both leukaemias and solid tumours [55].
 Healthy HSCs are already capable of self-renewal, so may require less oncogenic
 events to become cancerous [56].
 The concept of a small pool of cancer stem-cells driving the large heterogeneou
s pool of cancer cells has many implications for how we treat cancer - these
 are the cells that must be targeted for the efficient and long lasting
 cure of cancer [56].

The MLL gene
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Translocations involving the MLL gene (also known as ALL-1, Htrx, HRX) on
 chromosome 11q23 are found in over 70% of infant leukaemias [58] and approximat
ely 10% of adult AML cases [51].
 Leukaemias with this translocation have a unique profile, and often a poor
 patient prognosis [59].
 As a result, a great deal of interest has been generated in the MLL gene
 and its translocation partners.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Homozygous (-/-) MLL mice knockouts are embryonic lethal, and are unable
 to produce haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) [60].
 Heterozygous (+/-) knockouts display retarded growth and anaemia, as well
 as other haematopoietic abnormalities [61].
 Inducible mouse knockout models show that MLL is required for bone marrow
 maintenance, with bone marrow failure approximately three weeks after MLL
 deletion.
 Further to this, cells lacking MLL in MLL+/- chimeras are selectively lost
 from the bone marrow, consistent with a decrease in proliferation of myelo-eryt
hroid progenitors lacking MLL [62].
 However, haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) lacking MLL are locked in ectopic
 cell cycle entry [62].

There are 87 documented MLL translocation partners of which 51 have been
 characterised at the molecular level [63].
 The five most frequent translocation partners, AF4, AF9, ENL, AF10 and
 AF6 account for approximately 80% of cases [63].
 Translocations within the MLL gene usually occur within an 8.3 kb region
 known as the breakpoint cluster region (bcr) [64].
 The bcr contains exons 5-11 as well as a number of repeat regions, notably
 8 direct Alu SINE repeats, 5 direct L1 and L2 LINE repeats and 2 MER elements,
 as well as a number of putative Topoisomerase II binding sites and a SAR/MAR
 [65] (see 7 - Abbreviations for full names).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A paper by Scharf et al.
 in 2007 showed that an internal promoter exists within the bcr of the murine
 Mll gene, and that etoposide-induced double strand breaks colocalise with
 the putative RNA Polymerase II binding site in human peripheral blood mononucle
ar cells, rather than a nearby topoisomerase II binding site [66].
 The idea than RNAP II might bind to the bcr of MLL is an attractive one
 â€“ a stretch of DNA cleared of nucleosomes would explain the DNase I hypersensit
ive site mapped to the same region [67] and the histone modifications that
 have been found within the MLL bcr [68].

The MLL protein
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
MLL is a large protein, consisting of multiple domains.
 It has been shown too require assembly and targeting by multiple other
 proteins, such as WDR5, RBPB5 and ASH2L [69].
 MLL contains three N-terminal AT hooks, responsible for binding the minor
 groove of AT-rich DNA; a CxxC zinc finger domain homologous to that found
 in DNA methyltransferase I; a transcriptional activation (TA) domain which
 binds CREB binding protein, a histone acetyltransferase and a SET domain
 which can methylate the lysine 4 residue of histone 4 (H3K4).
 Several of these domains are also present within the Drosophila trithorax
 complex, such as the speckled nuclear localization domains and SET domain.
 It is thought that MLL binds DNA in a non-sequence-specific manner via
 its AT-hook domains [70] and zinc finger domain [71].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments pulling down chromatin
 fragments associated with MLL have shown interactions with 90% of elements
 occupied by RNAP II, including both promoters and intergenic regions [72,
 73].
 This demonstrates its role as a global regulator of gene expression, much
 like the Drosophila trithorax genes to which it shares homology.

\begin_layout Standard
MLL is involved in the maintenance of expression of the Hox genes [61] and
 is required for embryonic haematopoiesis [75].
 Much work has gone into the function of MLL fusion proteins and revealed
 a complex and diverse picture (see reviews [51] and [74]).
 Many mouse models of MLL-fusion protein mediated leukaemias have been developed
 using knock-in systems, providing a system with which to study the mechanisms
 of MLL directed leukaemogenesis (Figure 11).
 For example, it has been shown that DOT1L knockouts are not susceptible
 to transformation which the fusion protein MLL-AF10, suggesting that this
 H3K79 methyltransferase may be involved in the reprogramming of the epigenetic
 state of certain genes, notably the HoxA cluster genes [76].
 The up-regulation of the Hoxa7 and Hoxa9 appears to be important, and is
 required for transformation by the MLL-ENL fusion protein [77].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally, it seems that fusion proteins often recruit a large number of
 chromatin remodelling factors to the normal gene targets of MLL, changing
 the histone methylation marks and increasing the level of expression.

Breakage first and contact first models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a chromosomal translocaiton to form, two simultaenous DSBs must be extremely
 close in three-dimensional space.
 Two models have been described to explain how DSBs may meet in the nucleus
 â€“ the breakage first model and the contact first model.
 The breakage first model states that double strand breaks can form anywhere
 and are able to freely diffuse in the nuclear space.
 They undergo large scale movement through the nucleus until they meet and
 are joined.
 The contact first model states that the two double strand breaks form in
 sequences already close to each other within the nuclear space.
 Large scale chromatin movements are not required for the two DSBs to meet.

Hypothesis and aim of thesis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Talk about the why of translocations - specificity and frequency of certain
 translocations means that partner selection can't be completely random.
 Hypothesis and aims: that specific gene pairs are predisposed to chromosomal
 translocations because they are co-localising at transcription factories.
 Aims of the project are to investigate the genome-wide association networks
 of specific oncogenes and see if gene pair co-localisation frequency matches
 up with gene-pair translocation frequency.
