Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The nucleus of a human cell contains approximately 2 metres of DNA 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, requiring a huge degree of compaction to fit within the nucleus.
 In addition to storing DNA the nucleus itself is a highly functional organelle,
 responsible for the huge variety of complex cellular processes.
 To achieve this, the contents of the nucleus are very precisely organised
 into sub-nuclear compartments which specialise in processes such as transcripti
on and replication.
 In addition to the organisation of the nuclear proteome, chromatin itself
 is thought to be organised.
 In this chapter I will discuss the current understanding of nuclear structure
 and organisation, how we have obtained this knowledge, and how it may play
 a part in the initiation of certain cancers.

Chromatin
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chromatin is a general term used to describe the DNA found in the nucleus
 along with the plethora of proteins that bind to it.
 There are two principle forms of chromatin: 
\emph on
euchromatin 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
heterochromatin
\emph default
.
 These were first described in the early twentieth century by the difference
 in staining within the nucleus

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Heterochromatin stains darkly because it remains highly condensed during
 interphase, typically relocating to the nuclear periphery.
 can be split into 
\emph on
constitutive heterochromatin
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
facultative heterochromatin
\emph default
; the former describing heterochromatin found in all cell types typically
 containing repetitive elements found in centromeres and telomeres; the
 latter describing less compacted inactive chromatin which may vary between
 cell types as they differentiate.
 Heterochromatin is well known as being a repressive environment for gene
 expression; studies whereby normally active regions are artificially tethered
 to the inner nuclear membrane show the ablation of gene expression

 Its looser compaction allows access to the DNA by the cellular machinery;
 enabling the binding of transcription factors and the initiation of transcripti
on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differences between heterochromatin and euchromatin lie within the proteins
 that they contain.
 Chromatin acts as a platform for proteins to bind to, differences in histone
 modifications, variants, nucleosome packing and DNA modifications affect
 the accessibility and binding profile of the chromatin, and so how the
 DNA is interpreted by the cell.

To package DNA, the double helix is wrapped around an octomer of core histones:
 two H2A, two H2B, two H3 and two H4.
 146 base pairs of DNA wrap around these positively charged proteins to
 form the nucleosome, which is then bound by histone H1 with linker DNA
 to make a total of 166 base pairs

 This packing forms the 10 nm fibre, often known as 'beads on a string'
 due to its appearance in electron micrographs.
 At their most basic level, histones function to compact DNA by counteracting
 the negative charge of the phosphorylated back bone.

Histone modifications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Core histones have flexible tails which extend outside of the nucleosome,
 and are accessible to proteins within the nuclear matrix.
 These tails can be post-translationally modified at a large number of residues
 and these modifications can affect the packing of chromatin

 The large number of combinatorial possibilities that result result from
 these modifications have been dubbed the 'Histone Code' 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Strahl2000a"

\end_inset

, different modifications are related to different chromatin states: for
 example, active promoters are typically enriched for di- and tri-methylation
 of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4), inactive promoters for H3K27me3 and H3K9me3

As chromatin immunoprecipitation (

 techniques (ChIP on chip) and next generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq), our
 understanding of how these marks affect chromatin biology on a genome-wide
 scale has advanced dramatically.
 Profiling chromatin types using multiple datasets covering a large number
 of histone modifications is sufficient to predict the identity and function
 of regions in the genome with a high degree of accuracy, revealing previously
 unknown enhancers

Histone variants
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to histone tail modifications, chromatin can be modified by
 the incorporation of histone variants.
 Canonical core histone genes are found in clustered repeat arrays within
 the genome, are transcribed during replication and are extremely tightly
 conserved between species.
 Histone variants are found as single genes spread through the genome, and
 are subject to far greater diversity

CENP-A is a human variant of histone H3 which replaces the canonical histone
 in centromeric heterochromatin.
 It is a key factor in the establishment of the centromeres and kinetochores
 required for mitosis.
 The histone variant is incorporated with the help of a number of chaperone
 proteins, including HJURP, after replication of DNA has finished

 and the visualisation of transcription factories has demanded a new model
 for the action of RNA Polymerase II 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Cook1999"

\end_inset

.
 The revised model proposes that instead of RNA Polymerase II freely diffusing
 to active genes and tracking along the gene body, it is the genes that
 are recruited to transcription factories and the genes that track through
 a stationary polymerase.
 Such a model provides a better explanation for the mechanics of transcription
 - clustering of transcriptional activity may enable the cell to conduct
 transcription in a much more efficient manner; HeLa nuclei have a 1 ÂµM
 concentration of active RNA Polymerase II, whereas the local concentration
 within transcription factories is closer to 1 mM

Hypothesis and aim of thesis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Talk about the why of translocations - specificity and frequency of certain
 translocations means that partner selection can't be completely random.
 Hypothesis and aims: that specific gene pairs are predisposed to chromosomal
 translocations because they are co-localising at transcription factories.
 Aims of the project are to investigate the genome-wide association networks
 of specific oncogenes and see if gene pair co-localisation frequency matches
 up with gene-pair translocation frequency.
