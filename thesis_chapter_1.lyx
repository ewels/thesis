Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The nucleus is a highly functional organelle, responsible for a huge variety
 of complex cellular processes.
 To achieve this, the contents of the nucleus are organised into sub-nuclear
 compartments which specialise in processes such as transcription and replicatio
n.
 In this chapter I will discuss the current understanding of nuclear structure
 and organisation, how we have obtained this knowledge, and how it may play
 a part in the initiation of certain cancers.

\begin_layout Section
Chromatin
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Chromatin is a general term used to describe the DNA packaged in the plethora
 of proteins that bind to it.
 There are two principle forms of chromatin: 
\emph on
euchromatin 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
heterochromatin
\emph default
.
 These were first described in the early twentieth century due to their
 differential staining within the nucleus 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Heitz1928"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Heterochromatin stains darkly because it remains highly condensed during
 interphase, typically relocating to the nuclear periphery.
 It can be split into 
\emph on
constitutive heterochromatin
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
facultative heterochromatin
\emph default
; the former describing heterochromatin found in all cell types, typically
 containing repetitive elements found in centromeres and telomeres; the
 latter describing less compacted inactive chromatin which can vary between
 cell types as they differentiate.
 Heterochromatin is well known as being a repressive environment for gene
 expression; studies whereby normally active regions are artificially tethered
 to the inner nuclear membrane show the ablation of gene expression

 Euchromatin is the site of most geneic transcription, as shown by the presence
 of RNA Polymerase and nascent transcriptions found in early fractionation
 studies 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Its looser compaction allows access to the DNA by the cellular machinery;
 enabling the binding of transcription factors and the initiation of transcripti
on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The differences between heterochromatin and euchromatin lie within the proteins
 that they contain.
 Chromatin acts as a platform for proteins to bind to, differences in histone
 modifications, variants, nucleosome packing and DNA modifications affect
 the accessibility and binding profile of the chromatin, and so how the
 DNA is interpreted by the cell.

To package DNA, the double helix is wrapped around an octomer of core histones:
 two H2A, two H2B, two H3 and two H4.
 146 base pairs of DNA wrap around these positively charged proteins to
 form the nucleosome, which is then bound by histone H1 with linker DNA
 to make a total of 166 base pairs 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 This packing forms the 10 nm fibre, often known as 'beads on a string'
 due to its appearance in electron micrographs.
 At their most basic level, histones function to compact DNA by counteracting
 the negative charge of the phosphorylated back bone.

Histone modifications
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Core histones have flexible tails which extend outside of the nucleosome,
 and are accessible to proteins within the nuclear matrix.
 These tails can be post-translationally modified at a large number of residues
 and these modifications can affect the packing of chromatin 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 as well as which proteins can bind.
 The large number of combinatorial possibilities that result result from
 these modifications have been dubbed the 'Histone Code' 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Strahl2000a"

\end_inset

, different modifications are related to different chromatin states.
 For example, active promoters are typically enriched for di- and tri-methylatio
n of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) whilst inactive promoters are enriched for
 H3K27me3 and H3K9me3 (Fig

As chromatin immunoprecipitation (

 techniques (ChIP on chip) and next generation sequencing (ChIP-Seq), our
 understanding of how histone modifications affect chromatin biology on
 a genome-wide scale has advanced dramatically.
 Profiling chromatin types using multiple datasets covering a large number
 of histone modifications is sufficient to predict the identity and function
 of regions in the genome with a high degree of accuracy, revealing previously
 unknown enhancers

Histone variants
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to histone tail modifications, chromatin can be modified by
 the incorporation of histone variants.
 Canonical core histone genes are found in clustered repeat arrays within
 the genome, are transcribed during replication and are highly conserved
 between species.
 Histone variants are found as single genes spread through the genome, and
 are subject to far greater diversity

\begin_layout Standard
CENP-A is a human variant of histone H3 which replaces the canonical histone
 in centromeric heterochromatin.
 It is a key factor in the establishment of the centromeres and kinetochores
 required for mitosis.
 The histone variant is incorporated with the help of a number of chaperone
 proteins, including HJURP, after replication of DNA has finished 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 CENP-A is essential for the formation of centromeres.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another frequent histone variant found in humans is H3.3, which differs from
 canonical H3 by just four amino acids 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Talbert2010"

 This histone variant is found within transcribed genes, promoters and regulator
y elements, and is thought to be laid down during transcriptional elongation
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Nucleosomes containing H3.3 appear to be less stable than canonical nucleosomes,
 with a high turnover 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 It is possible that this increased turnover of the nucleosomal components
 helps to keep the chromatin open and accessible to the transcriptional
 machinery

 They found ridges to be gene-dense, highly transcribed, have a high GC

The discovery of transcription factories has demanded a new model for the
 action of RNA Polymerase II 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Cook1999"

\end_inset

.
 The revised model proposes that instead of RNA Polymerase II freely diffusing
 to active genes and tracking along the gene body, genes are recruited to
 transcription factories and are pulled through a stationary polymerase.
 Such a model provides a better explanation for the mechanics of transcription
 - clustering of transcriptional activity may enable the cell to conduct
 transcription in a much more efficient manner; HeLa nuclei have a 1 ÂµM
 concentration of active RNA Polymerase II, whereas the local concentration
 within transcription factories is closer to 1 mM 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Additionally, a polymerase enzyme moving along a gene would rotate with
 the helix of the DNA wrapping the nascent transcript around the template.
 Genes pulled through static transcription factories would extrude their
 RNA transcripts into the nucleoplasm

\begin_layout Standard
After the demonstration that genes share transcription factories, a number
 of groups postulated that specific genes may colocalise at a subset of
 transcription factories.
 The self-organising principle applied to transcription factories would
 predict this; just as the local concentration of active RNA Polymerase
 II is elevated by the clustering of transcribing units, the local concentration
 of transcription factors that bind to those transcribed units will also
 be elevated

 Co-localising Klf1 dependent genes associated with these Klf1 specific
 transcription factories at a high frequency, and a number of these gene
 associations were lost upon the knockout of Klf1 expression.
 These data suggest that a network of Klf1 specific transcription factories
 exist within mouse erythroid tissues, and that Klf1 specific genes are
 preferentially recruited to these sites

 Indeed, although statistically significant, the gene associations detected

The recent development of all-to-all methods has allowed the confirmation

 This approach has many advantages; such an unbiased approach allows the

 GM12878.
 Only a small proportion of the looping interactions uncovered were shared

 a single cell line.
 The majority of TSS looping interactions could be classified as interacting
 with enhancer elements, promoters or regions bound by the structural protein
 CTCF.
 Looping interactions with enhancer elements were significantly enriched

 If genetic templates are mobile and transcription factories are fixed,
 then the nucleus may be able to use the process of transcription as a tool
 to fold the genome into specific conformations.

 HR is primarily active during cell replication and rarely leads to serious

 translocations if two sequences with similar repeat regions are nearby,

DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors are commonly used as chemotherapeutic agents
 and work by decreasing the ligation rate, disrupting the cleavage / ligation
 equilibrium.
 This leads to an increase in DNA cleavage and an accumulation of double
 strand breaks, triggering the cell DNA damage response and leading to cell
 death by apoptosis

Breakage first and contact first models
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a chromosomal translocation to form, two double strand breaks must exist
 simultaneously and be adjacent in three-dimensional space.
 Two models have been described to explain how DSBs may meet in the nucleus
 â€“ the breakage first model and the contact first model.
 The breakage first model states that double strand breaks can form anywhere
 and are able to freely diffuse in the nuclear space.
 They undergo large scale movement through the nucleus until they meet and
 are joined.
 The contact first model states that the two double strand breaks form in
 sequences already close to each other within the nuclear space.
 Large scale chromatin movements are not required for the two DSBs to meet.
