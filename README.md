Thesis
======

Introduction
------------
PhD thesis repositry for Phil Ewels, 2012. Hopefully this will allow me to keep everything backed up, and allow version control and branching for revisions.

Structure
---------
Everything is written in LyX, with the plan to export into LaTeX at a later point and pimp with an imported LaTeX header each time.

There is a master LyX file, then each chapter is separate to keep things simple.
